# GoTTA htmx Stack

This started off simple Go & HTMX stack but it has expanded as I wanted to try out a few other technologies.
It follows the known "GoTTH" stack but also adds Alpine.js to become "GoTTA H", you know... you've "gotta htmx".

**Go** - Self explainatory
**T**  - Templ
**T**  - TailwindCSS
**A**  - Alpine.js

**H**  - HTMX

It also utilizes Air for hot reloading during development.
