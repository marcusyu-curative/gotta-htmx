# "GoTTA Htmx" Stack

This started off simple Go & HTMX stack but it has expanded as I wanted to try out a few other technologies.
It follows the known "GoTTH" stack but also adds Alpine.js to become "GoTTA H", you know... you've "gotta htmx".

```plain
Go - Golang powered back-end
T  - Templ
T  - TailwindCSS
A  - Alpine.js

Htmx
```

It also utilizes [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air?tab=readme-ov-file) for hot reloading during development.
